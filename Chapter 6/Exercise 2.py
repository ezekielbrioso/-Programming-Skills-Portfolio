Chapter 6 - Exercise 2: Movie Tickets
A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if

they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their

age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket

while True:
    age = input("How old are you?")
    if age == "quit":
        break
    age = int(age)
    if age < 3:
        print("Your ticket is free")
    elif age < 12:
        print("Your ticket is $10") 
    else:
        print("Your ticket is $15")
